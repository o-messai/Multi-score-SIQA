## Multi-score-SIQA </br>

This is the implementation code for our paper published in @ICIP2022 conference: </br>
"End-to-end deep multi-score model for No-reference stereoscopic image quality assessment" </br>
link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01374

## Online web-application

You can try out our proposed model online at: https://oussama-messai.com/quality-assessment </br>
The model will run on the browser once it's loaded (on-edge mode), therefore the run-time depends on your machine. </br>
